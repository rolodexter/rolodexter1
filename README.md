# rolodexter1

**rolodexter1** is an open-source social AI model designed to simulate and compute socialization patterns, personalities, and psychiatric conditions. It features a universal library of personality types and integrates the DSM-5 framework to replicate psychiatric disorders for research, development, and interactive applications. The model powers dynamic, personality-driven interactions and serves as a foundation for innovative AI-driven social systems.

## Features
- **[Universal Personality Library](docs/Universal_Personality_Library.md)**: A master reference of all personality types, enabling realistic simulation of human-like behaviors.
- **[DSM-5-Based Simulation](docs/DSM-5_Based_Simulation.md)**: Accurate replication of psychiatric disorders as defined by the DSM-5 for educational, research, or therapeutic use.
- **[Dynamic Social Interaction](docs/Dynamic_Social_Interaction.md)**: Computes and adapts to socialization patterns in real-time, enabling personalized and context-sensitive interactions.
- **[Personality-Powered AI](docs/Personality_Powered_AI.md)**: The ability to "power" personalities for interactive systems like chatbots, virtual assistants, and NPCs in games.

## Installation
To get started with **rolodexter1**, clone the repository and set up the environment.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rolodexter/rolodexter1.git
cd rolodexter1
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use **rolodexter1** to simulate a personality interaction:

```python
from rolodexter import PersonalitySimulator

# Initialize the simulator with a predefined personality type
simulator = PersonalitySimulator(personality="Extraverted")
response = simulator.generate_response("Hello! How are you?")
print(response)
```

This example demonstrates how **rolodexter1** can generate contextually appropriate responses based on a personality profile.

2. **Customizable Parameters**: Allows developers to fine-tune personality traits to fit specific use cases.
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Supports real-time adjustment of personality traits based on interaction context.

## Use Cases
- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Create AI-powered agents with distinct, human-like personalities.
- **Gaming NPCs**: Develop non-playable characters with unique behavioral traits for immersive gaming experiences.
- **Therapeutic Simulations**: Simulate diverse personality types for training therapists or conducting psychological research.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with additional psychological frameworks, such as Enneagram or HEXACO.
- Support for cultural and regional personality variations.
- Improved dynamic adaptation algorithms for more nuanced interactions.
